     <h2>What is an escape room?</h2>
     <p>Escape room is a fun experience for a group usually from 2 to 6 people,
     when the players are locked inside a room (or multiple ones) and need to
     figure out series of riddles, logical tasks and questions to get out in a
     time limit (usually 60 minutes)</p>
     <h2>Story</h2>
     <p>It is winter 1944, and France is occupied by German armies. You, as a
     supportive parachute reinforcements, have 70 minutes to figure out what
     happened to two groups of Allied units under the command of Lt. col. Lloyd
     Ramsey and his forward scout unit under the command of corporal Conner.
     Both groups went silent, and have been lastly spotted in this war hideout.
     Be wary! There has been reported a march of Axis units on this position
     and you would became a prisoners, should you not be careful. Become heroes
     and venture on a rescue mission!</p>
